# Unit 1 Lesson 3: Tables and Lists
## Lab: Planetary Table 🌍 🔭

### Directions
* Your goal is to [**recreate this table**](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/tables/assessment-finished/planets-data.html) using your knowledge of basic and advanced HTML table structure.
* **After** you've gotten your table structure to match, you may style this table according to your own preferences; however, you styling should enhance the _clarity_ and _readability_ of your table. A couple of things to keep in mind:
  * Your column and row headers should be bold.
  * If you opt for color, lighter colors are easier on the eyes.
  * Alternating colors can make it easier for the reader to distinguish between rows.

* As always...
